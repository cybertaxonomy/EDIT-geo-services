Distribution and occurrence maps as well as legends can be generated. for a documentation see http://dev.e-taxonomy.eu/trac/wiki/MapRestServiceApi (This documentation is outdated!!!)
* mapviewer: See http://edit.africamuseum.be/edit_wp5/geo/mapviewer/maps.html

The git repository is replicated at two locations:

* https://github.com/cybertaxonomy/EDIT-geo-services
